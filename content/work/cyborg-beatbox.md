## _A browser based, playable drum machine based on hardware drum pad samplers._

Cyborg Beatbox was my first serious web development project and as a keen musician, it was a project that I was really passionate about. I wanted to ensure that my implementation was visually attractive and minimalistic much like many of the hardware samplers that I have owned and used in the past. I also learned some of the fundamental concepts of React while working on this project including components, state and props as well as developing my understanding of functional programming techniques in ES6 through using higher order functions.

This project formed part of the portfolio of projects that I completed while working towards the FreeCodeCamp.com Frontend Libraries certification.
