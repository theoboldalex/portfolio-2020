## _A movie quote generator that displays a classic movie quote at random._

This is a simple random movie quote generator that dispalys a random movie quote to the user and updates the quote each time the user clicks a button. It was one of the portfolio projects that I completed while working towards the FreeCodecamp.com Frontend Libraries certification.
