## _Uplift Energy Therapies are a health and wellness business specialising in Reiki and Yogic therapy techniques. This site acts as an online business card for potential clients to learn more about the business and make enquiries about treatments._

This project was implemented using Hugo to generate a static site and provide scope for the client to manage content on the site as their business grows. While simple, this site showcases my knowledge of fundamental HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as the concept of 'the loop' common to most content management systems including Wordpress.
