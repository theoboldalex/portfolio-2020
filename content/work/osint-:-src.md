## _OSINT : SRC is an open source, operational intelligence sharing platform built around user generated content._

In the travel risk management industry, the speed of response to global events can make all the difference in keeping both people and assets safe. While working within the GSOC of a commercial security company I realised the opportunity to leverage the speed, reliability and ease of use of modern technology stacks to provide near real-time security threat updates and intelligence reports to users wherever they are across the globe.

During the planning phase of the project, I distilled the application's purpose down to its core and heavily focussed my planning around key functionality. From this, I decided that the user must be able to;

- See at a glance, security threats within their area of interest
- Have access to a user friendly CMS to share intelligence through the platform
- Manage and update content quickly and efficiently
- Receive notifications of security threats
