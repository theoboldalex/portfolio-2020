## _OSINT : SRC is an open source, operational intelligence sharing platform built around user generated content._

In the travel risk management industry, the speed of response to global events can make all the difference in keeping both people and assets safe. While working within the GSOC of a commercial security company I realised the opportunity to leverage the speed, reliability and ease of use of modern technology stacks to provide near real-time security threat updates and intelligence reports to users wherever they are across the globe.

The application is implemented using Vue Js and Google's Firebase and JavaScript Maps API to perform CRUD operations on user generated content and display data in an insightful and meaningful way.

This project is very much a work in progress and I am currently developing an iOS application to partner with the Firebase backend. This will allow users to recieve notifications on the go based on their location in relation to any threat that may arise.
